Welcome to Little Helper (Beta)

Hey! Ben made this just for you.

Since this is a beta version and isn't signed by Microsoft yet,
Windows might show a security warning. This is totally normal!

If you see a blue "Windows protected your PC" screen, just click:

    "More info"  -->  "Run anyway"

Have fun, and let him know what you think!
