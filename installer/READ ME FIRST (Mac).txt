Welcome to Little Helper (Beta)

Hey! Ben made this just for you.

TO INSTALL:
Drag "Little Helper" to your Applications folder.

FIRST TIME OPENING:
Since this is a beta and isn't signed by Apple yet, you might
see "Little Helper can't be opened because it is from an
unidentified developer."

No worries! Just:
1. Right-click (or Control-click) on Little Helper
2. Choose "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the dialog

You only need to do this once. After that, it opens normally!

Have fun, and let him know what you think!
